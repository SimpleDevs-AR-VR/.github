# SimpleDevs - AR/VR 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

To break up URLs so that they don't hyperlink inside of Github, use the Zero-Space Width character `&#xfeff;` or &#65279;
* For HTTPS URLs, add between `https` and `:`.
* For SSH URLs, add after `@`.

## Important Repositories:

### Nav Mesh
Simulations, Iterations, and Experiments with AI pathfinding, starting off with Unity's NavMesh pathfinding and extending from there.

### Continuous Crowds
A simulation of continuous crowds, through vector field-based pathfinding. Not scalable.

### 2D Boids Test
An attempt at Pathfinding using Boid behavior. It works reasonably... not well. Boids is meant for more like group-based obstacle avoidance, not pathfinding. Though the results are interesting.
